                  <p class="p"> For I'm called Little Buttercup—dear Little Buttercup,
                Though I could never tell why,
             But still I'm called Buttercup—poor little Buttercup,
                Sweet Little Buttercup I!

                    Aye, Little Buttercup—and well called—for you're the rosiest,the roundest, and the reddest beauty in all Spithead.

                    Red, am I? and round—and rosy! Maybe, for I have dissembled well! But hark ye, my merry friend—hast ever thought that beneath a gay and
                    frivolous exterio there may lurk a canker-worm which is slowly but surely eating its way into one's very heart?

                  <p> 
                    No, my lass, I can't say I've ever thought that.
