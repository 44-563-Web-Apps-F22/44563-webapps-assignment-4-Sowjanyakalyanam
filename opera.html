                SONG—SIR JOSEPH
              
                                      I am the monarch of the sea,
                                      The ruler of the Queen's Navee,
                                    Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants.
                  COUSIN HEBE.  And we are his sisters, and his cousins and his
                aunts!
                  REL.          And we are his sisters, and his cousins, and his
                aunts!
                  SIR JOSEPH.         When at anchor here I ride,
                                           My bosom swells with pride,
                                         And I snap my fingers at a foeman's
                taunts;
                  COUSIN HEBE.  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
                aunts!
                  ALL.          And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
                aunts!
                  SIR JOSEPH.         But when the breezes blow,
                                      I generally go below,
                                    And seek the seclusion that a cabin grants;
                  COUSIN HEBE.  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
                aunts!
                  ALL.          And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
                aunts!
                                    His sisters and his cousins,
                                    Whom he reckons up by dozens,
                                      And his aunts!

              <h6 class="BUT"> BUT. </h6>
                  <p> For I'm called Little Buttercup—dear Little Buttercup,
                Though I could never tell why,
             But still I'm called Buttercup—poor little Buttercup,
                Sweet Little Buttercup I!

                  <p>
                    Aye, Little Buttercup—and well called—for you're the rosiest,the roundest, and the reddest beauty in all Spithead.
                  </p>
              <h6 class="BUT"> BUT. </h6>
                  <p> 
                    Red, am I? and round—and rosy! Maybe, for I have dissembled well! But hark ye, my merry friend—hast ever thought that beneath a gay and
                    frivolous exterio there may lurk a canker-worm which is slowly but surely eating its way into one's very heart?
                   </p>
              <h6 class="BOAT"> BOAT. </h6>
                  <p> 
                    No, my lass, I can't say I've ever thought that.
                  </p>
              <h6 class="DICK"> DICK. </h6>
                  <p> 
                    I have thought it often. (All recoil from him.)

              <h6 class="BUT"> BUT. </h6>
                  <p> Yes, you look like it! What's the matter with the man? Isn't he well?
                  </p>
              <h6 class="BOAT"> BOAT. </h6>
                  <p> Don't take no heed of him; that's only poor Dick Deadeye.</p>
              <h6 class="DICK"> DICK. </h6>
                  <p> I say—it's a beast of a name, ain't it—Dick Deadeye? </p>
              <h6 class="h6"> It's not a nice name.  </h6>

              <h5 class="R"> RECITATIVE </h5>

                   <p> Ha! That name! Remorse! remorse!</p>
              <h6 class="RALPH"> RALPH. </h6>
                   <p> But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man who hails from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the fore-yard arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the main-truck or his slacks on the main-deck.

                  <p> My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to melancholy. You should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will be here this afternoon to claim your promised hand.</p>
              <h6 class="JOS"> JOS </h6>
                  <p> Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem—reverence—venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man; but oh, I cannot love him! My heart is already given. </p>
